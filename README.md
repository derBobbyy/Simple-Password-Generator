# Simple-Password-Generator

A simple password generator written with Python


## Features

- Please only run the "main.py".
- You can find your generated password under "output/password.txt"
- In order to be able to run this script, you need the "output" folder and the "password.txt" stored in there. If this is not available, it can lead to errors!
- In "config.py" you can set how you would like your password to be


## Important
I am not a professional in python development. This little script was just for me to learn and can be very irritating for advanced developers.
